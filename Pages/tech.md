I began self-study of mathematics and computer science during COVID using free online resources on EdX and Coursera.  While it all started as a hobby, I was inspired by the work and decided to pursue formal study. After earning a post-baccalaureate in Computer Science from Drexel University, I spent a year exploring the Nursing PhD program at Penn State via their PhD Graduate Fellowship program but found my passion was Computer Science.  After the school year was complete, I transferred back to Drexel to study AI and Machine Learning with concentrations in Computer Science, Computational AI, and Computer Security.

## Programming Languages

I enjoy learning to create software solutions in any language and platform but have the most experience using:
