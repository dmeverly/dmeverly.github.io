I began self-study of mathematics and computer science during COVID using free online resources on EdX and Coursera.  While it all started as a hobby, I felt inspired by the work and sought formal study at Drexel University.

I've also worked on a number of process improvement projects as an EPIC Certified Physician Builder.

## Procedural Skills

I've had the privilage to regularly perform a number of bedside procedures, including:
