As an ICU Nurse Practitioner—shaped by the COVID surge—I saw how rigid processes strain care teams. 
Determined to find a better way, I dove into computer science and machine learning. Today, I blend frontline clinical insight 
with AI/ML to build solutions that streamline workflows and tackle complexity in healthcare and beyond.

I began self-study of mathematics and computer science during COVID using free online resources on EdX and Coursera.  While it all started as a hobby, I was inspired by the work and decided to pursue formal study. After earning a post-baccalaureate in Computer Science from Drexel University, I spent a year exploring the Nursing PhD program at Penn State via their PhD Graduate Fellowship program but found my passion was Computer Science.  After the school year was complete, I transferred back to Drexel to study AI and Machine Learning.
