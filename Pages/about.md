As an ICU Nurse Practitioner, I have seen firsthand how rigid processes strain care teams and compromise outcomes.  
During the COVID pandemic, I saw how antiquated systems processes were a hindrence to patient care and an added burden to already stressed healthcare providers.  
Determined to find a better way, I returned to my roots in computer science and dove into AI and machine learning.  

Today, I combine frontline clinical insight with a growing technical toolkit to design intelligent systems that streamline workflows and solve complex problems — in healthcare and beyond.
