I have worked as an Acute Care Nurse Practitioner since 2017, specializing in care of criticall-ill adults in Emergency, Pulmonology, and Critical Care Medicine.  I enjoy teaching new students and providers and maintain an ongoing relationship with local NP schools.  I've also worked on a number of process improvement projects as an EPIC Certified Physician Builder.
