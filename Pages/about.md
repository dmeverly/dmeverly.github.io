I have worked as an Acute Care Nurse Practitioner since 2017, specializing in care of criticall-ill adults in Emergency, Pulmonology, and Critical Care Medicine.  I enjoy teaching new students and providers and maintain an ongoing relationship with local NP schools.

I began self-study of mathematics and computer science during COVID using free online resources on EdX and Coursera.  While it all started as a hobby, I was inspired by the work and decided to pursue formal study. After earning a post-baccalaureate in Computer Science from Drexel University, I spent a year exploring the Nursing PhD program at Penn State via their PhD Graduate Fellowship program but found my passion was Computer Science.  After the school year was complete, I transferred back to Drexel to study AI and Machine Learning with concentrations in Computer Science, Computational AI, and Computer Security.
