As an ICU Nurse Practitioner during the COVID pandemic, I saw how antiquated systems processes were a hindrance to patient care and an added burden to already stressed healthcare providers. Determined to find a better way, I returned to the study of computer science and dove into AI and machine learning.  

Today, I combine frontline clinical insight with a growing technical toolkit to design customized, intelligent systems for solving modern problems.

    “Within WellSpan, we view the transition of care from the ICU to the hospitalist team as a critical time 
    when problems can be missed and patient safety can be at risk. 
    David created a standardized transfer note which improved communications and relationships with our hospitalist group and which supports our patient safety goals.  
    This tool is now adopted systemwide in WellSpan.”
