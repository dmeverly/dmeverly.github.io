    “Within WellSpan, we view the transition of care from the ICU to the hospitalist team as a critical time 
    when problems can be missed and patient safety can be at risk.  
    David created a standardized transfer note which improved communications and relationships with our hospitalist group and which supports our patient safety goals.  
    This tool is now adopted systemwide in WellSpan.”
