  A few words from colleagues I've had the privilege to work with across clinical care, digital innovation, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

    “Within WellSpan, we view the transition of care from the ICU to the hospitalist team as a critical time 
    when problems can be missed and patient safety can be at risk.  
    David created a standardized transfer note which improved communications and relationships with our hospitalist group and which supports our patient safety goals.  
    This tool is now adopted systemwide in WellSpan.”
