IN DRAFT
I'm trained as a Nurse Practitioner and began my practice in Emergency Medicine in 2017.
I made the transition to Pulmonology and Critical Care Medicine during the COVID pandemic. 
As healthcare providers were asked to do more with less, I witnessed firsthand the real-world impact
of workflow ossification and was inspired to find ways to encourage more efficient processes. 
From system optimization projects to formal study of AI and machine learning techniques, 
I obtained the foundational knowledge necessary to identify and implement more intelligent solutions 
to everyday problems.  

, Pulmonology, and Critical Care Medicine since 2017. 

I have proven skills in the management of critically-ill adults, but I strive to learn something new every day.
I was originally a Computer Science major who transitioned to Nursing many years ago. 
Amidst the COVID pandemic, I was inspired by innovation all around me and wanted to develop new ways to help
people on a broader scale.  I revisited Computer Science and found a new passion in Artificial Intelligence. 

I have worked as an Acute Care Nurse Practitioner since 2017, specializing in care of criticall-ill adults in Emergency, Pulmonology, and Critical Care Medicine.  I enjoy teaching new students and providers and maintain an ongoing relationship with local NP schools.
