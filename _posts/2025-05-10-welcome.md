I'm based out of Franklin County, Pennsylvania, and work as a Nurse Practitioner.  I enjoy studying Computer Science, Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity.  I am always looking for ways to integrate my diverse interests and experiences. 


Welcome to my page!

### Background

I have practiced as an Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner in Emergency, Pulmonology, and Critical Care Medicine since 2017. I have proven skills in the management of critically-ill adults, but I strive to learn something new every day. 

I was originally a Computer Science major who transitioned to Nursing many years ago.  Amidst the COVID pandemic, I took to learning new ways to contribute to society and found a new passion in Artificial Intelligence.  I am currently studying Artfifical Intelligence and Machine Learning at Drexel University and have strong interest in the use of technology to improve healthcare quality, optimize workflows, and protect sensititve data through development of fast, reliable, and secure software solutions.
