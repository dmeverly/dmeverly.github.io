  Automated schedule transcription tool that reads a rotating template and generates a monthly employee work schedule.

# Problem Statement  
Manual transcription of rotating shift templates onto an annual calendar can be time-consuming and error-prone. After encountering this problem in a workplace setting, I independently developed a solution to automate the process and improve efficiency.

# Purpose  
To build a Python script that automates the conversion of a rotating shift template into a monthly employee schedule, minimizing manual input and reducing the chance for human error.

# Methods  
I analyzed a typical shift template and created a `pandas`-based script that:
- Cleans and parses structured Excel data
- Transcribes employee names and shifts onto a monthly calendar
- Outputs the final schedule as a `.csv` file

Additional features include:
- Flexible start week selection within the template
- Support for generating schedules over any number of months

# Results & Conclusion  
The tool produces clean, accurate schedules with minimal runtime. It eliminates the need for manual transcription and has proven effective in real-world scheduling workflows. It pairs well with my separately developed **Schedule Templater** to support full automation from template generation to calendar export.

# Future Work  
Plans include combining this scheduler with the templating engine to allow fully automated monthly schedule generation from customizable constraints and preferences.
