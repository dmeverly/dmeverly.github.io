<h3>Background</h3>

I have practiced as an Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner in Emergency, Pulmonology, and Critical Care Medicine since 2017. 
I have proven skills in the management of critically-ill adults, but I strive to learn something new every day.

I was originally a Computer Science major who transitioned to Nursing many years ago. 
Amidst the COVID pandemic, I took to learning new ways to contribute to society and found a new passion in Artificial Intelligence. 
I am currently studying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Drexel University and 
have strong interest in the use of technology to improve healthcare quality, optimize workflows, 
and protect sensitive data through the development of fast, reliable, and secure software solutions.
